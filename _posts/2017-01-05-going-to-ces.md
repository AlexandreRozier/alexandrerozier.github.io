description: "Impressions on CES 2017"

---

This 2017 edition of the [CES][ces] was a great discovery, as full of high-tech devices and surprising ideas.  
Amongst my favorite, here is a quick list !

### Cloud-based gaming

As the requirements of video games escalate, some people don't have the money to buy a rig able to deal with them. So, what to do ? 
[LiquidSky][liquid]'s attemp to disrupt the gaming industry was to create a cloud-based gaming platform, handling the video processing of video games and streaming
back the result to the end-user.
One could play the last COD with 30ms ping on highest video settings on a $100 laptop. Really impresssive in my opinion.

### Lumi Disk

Designed by the [Yellow Innovation][yellow] lab, this device is a connected hard-drive allowing user to automatically backup personal media and share them with their 
family.
